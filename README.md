Development of a Fuzzy Logic-base Voltage Control for a Prototype Distribution System.

This study aims to develop and implement a design for voltage control in a distribution system based on the technique of FL 
for the purpose of maintaining and stabilizing the voltage within its specified limits, thus delivering good service to 
the consumer.
